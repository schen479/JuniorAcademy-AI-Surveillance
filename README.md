# JuniorAcademy-AI-Surveillance

This is the code repository for Junior Academy's Team 5393, Ethical AI in Surveillance. 

## **Proposed Solution**

In order to combat the unethical aspects of using AI in surveillance, we plan on researching the possibility of having a program that detects crime/shoplifting happening, and only then does it store/send that footage to a main server. An important shareholder for this are the owners in the stores itself, as it allows them to focus their efforts to protect their products and quickly be notified of shoplifting. 

**Function:** Detects criminal activity at stores, blurs all non-criminal faces, and deletes all irrelevant footage of crime to maintain privacy.

We looked into tools that can allow us to only keep necessary footage and data. We discovered through research in AI tools that the federated learning model can allow decentralized servers to send only crucial data that pertains to crime to the main server, allowing us to discard the rest of the data that could be used maliciously.

## **Hypothesis**
If Python-based AI crime detection models are implemented in security and surveillance systems, then they will improve threat detection accuracy and enhance real-time responsiveness, whilst protecting the privacy of individuals.

## **Research Plan**

We will be collecting data from public police archives and running it in our program to see the accuracy of our model in detecting crime and accurately selecting what footage should be sent for further analysis.
